DocuFinder is a search enhancement tool for Google Drive, available on both iPad and macOS. It was born out of a personal need to better navigate the wealth of information stored on Google Drive.

Google Drive's search function is robust, yet lacks the ability to show search snippets â€” a short extract of the content of a document. This makes it hard to identify which document has the content you're looking for when the results list is huge. That's where DocuFinder comes in.

It helps you locate your documents easily through search keywords, providing you with search snippets just like Google Search to enhance your Google Drive search experience.
